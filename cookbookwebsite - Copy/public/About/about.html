<p1 style="font: size 20px;" class = "middle"> This book is a record of my favourite recipes, collected since I started cooking in my late teens and discovered the simple pleasures and adventures of cooking. </p1> 
<br>
<br>
<p1 style="font: size 20px;" class = "middle"> Believe it or not it started with the Woman’s Weekly Cooking Class Cookbook, (bought in 1976 for $3.98) as I wanted to cook Beef Wellington which was on the cover. I still have my original book which is very dog eared and stained and the book has come away from its cover, but I would never part with it. Over the years I have cooked at least 50% of the recipes in that cookbook. </p1> 
<br>
<br>
<p1 style="font: size 20px;" class = "middle"> My go to cookbook is Margaret Fulton’s Encyclopaedia of Food and Cookery 1983, it covers just about everything. It’s a hardcover so it has handled the wear and tear better with quite a few notations on the pages. </p1> 
<br>
<br>
<p1 style="font: size 20px;" class = "middle"> These recipes are from family, friends, many cookbooks, various cooking shows, magazines and some of my own original recipes. It includes my family’s favourite recipes as a record for them, some passed down from several generations. Many of these recipes were collected when my children were young, I was working part-time, and busy with family demands. </p1> 
<br>
<br>
<p1 style="font: size 20px;" class = "middle"> They are mostly simple and easy to follow, yet very tasty and fail safe even for the beginner cook. </p1> 
<br>
<br>
<p1 style="font: size 20px;" class = "middle"> Some recipes I have tweaked to my liking, remember that recipes are your guide but experimenting is fun and most importantly enjoy the adventure with food. </p1> 
<br>
<br>
<p1 style="font: size 20px;" class = "middle"> Happy cooking, Leanne </p1>
